    "### The Release Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gate 0: Clean working directory**\n",
    "\n",
    "Shipping with uncommitted changes is dangerous—you might release code that doesn't match what's in git. We check `git status --porcelain` and abort if there are any uncommitted files. The `--force` flag bypasses this for testing, but it's discouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Version bump**\n",
    "\n",
    "`nbdev_bump_version` increments the specified part of the version number (0=major, 1=minor, 2=patch) and updates `settings.ini`. The `--part` argument defaults to 2 (patch releases: 0.0.X), but you can bump minor (0.X.0) or major (X.0.0) as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dry-run mode, we manually calculate what the new version would be by splitting on `.`, incrementing the specified part, and rejoining. This gives accurate preview without modifying `settings.ini`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Sync version bump**\n",
    "\n",
    "The version change in `settings.ini` needs to be committed and pushed before we build. Otherwise, the PyPI package would have a different version than what's in git—a recipe for confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO: This is the second place we need `git_sync()`.** Same three-line pattern as in `sync()`: add, commit, push. Once we extract the helper, both call sites become `git_sync(message, verbose)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Build and upload**\n",
    "\n",
    "`nbdev_pypi` handles the full build process: creates isolated environment, installs build dependencies, builds sdist and wheel, uploads both to PyPI. Those setuptools warnings about `_MissingDynamic` are harmless—nbdev's dual `settings.ini`/`pyproject.toml` approach confuses setuptools slightly, but the build works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--skip-pypi` flag is useful for testing the full workflow without actually uploading. You can verify tagging and GitHub release creation without touching PyPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Git tagging**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tags mark specific commits as releases. We use annotated tags (`-a`) with a message, following the convention `vX.Y.Z`. The tag must be created *after* the version bump commit exists and *after* PyPI upload succeeds—if upload fails, we haven't polluted git with a tag for a non-existent release.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: GitHub release**\n",
    "\n",
    "`gh release create` with `--generate-notes` auto-generates release notes from commits since the last tag. This gives you a basic changelog without maintaining a separate `CHANGELOG.md` file. For projects without GitHub issues tracking, this is good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--skip-gh-release` flag lets you publish to PyPI and tag without creating the GitHub release, useful if you want to write custom release notes manually later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-release links**\n",
    "\n",
    "After a successful release, we show direct links to the PyPI package page and GitHub release. The repo URL comes from `gh repo view`, which reads the remote from `.git/config`—works whether the repo is in a personal account or an organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The upgrade reminder**\n",
    "\n",
    "After shipping a new version, your global `pj` installation is now outdated. We remind you to run `uv tool upgrade pj-sh` to get the version you just released. Otherwise, you'll be dogfooding an old version while the new one is live."

    "### Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why bump version first?** The version in `settings.ini` feeds into the build process. Bump, commit, push, *then* build ensures the package metadata reflects what's in git.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why tag after PyPI upload?** If the upload fails (auth issues, rate limits, package name conflicts), you haven't created a tag that points to a version that doesn't exist on PyPI. The tag should represent \"this commit is available as version X on PyPI\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why separate skip flags?** Sometimes you want to test tagging without uploading (`--skip-pypi`). Sometimes you want to upload but write release notes manually later (`--skip-gh-release`). Granular control beats all-or-nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why dry-run mode?** The first time you run `pj ship`, you want to see exactly what will happen without actually doing it. Dry-run shows the command sequence, calculates the new version, and exits without modifying anything. Build confidence before pulling the trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why --force?** Testing the release pipeline often involves uncommitted work-in-progress code. `--force` bypasses the clean working directory check so you can test the full workflow without stashing. Use sparingly—never force a real release."
